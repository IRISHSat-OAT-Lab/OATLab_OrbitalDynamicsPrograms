** 10/31: Weekly To-Do **

1) Finish algorithm for computing six classical orbital elements from r and v vectors /// DONE
    - NOTE: Special cases need to be done, though still need to figure out whether they are necessary or not
    
2) Start and finish algorithm for inverse of above algorithm (six classical elements --> r and v vectors) /// DONE
